### Website Layout
------

For the purpose of developing the user interface, I sought inspiration in successful websites such as [Bord Bia](https://www.bordbia.ie/recipes/), [Reciplate](https://reciplate.com/) and [TudoGostoso](https://www.tudogostoso.com.br/).

After taking notes on elements I liked from the websites above I loosely sketched the wireframes by hand. 
Once the drawings were ready, the actual pages were created using bootstrap and later stylized using CSS.

#### Colors:

The main color, Green, was chosen due to its popular representation of Irish-related content.
This shade of green, also known as the Shamrock Green, is often associated, in pop media, with Irish traditions such as the St. Patrick's Day.
I used this [Shutterstock palette](https://www.shutterstock.com/color/irish-green) as a guideline and the two main tones of green used in this project were #40C575 and #2d8a67


#### Typography:
##### Logo
- For the logo, I decided to use the [Sherwood](https://www.cdnfonts.com/sherwood.font) font. 
    - I opted for this font due to how well it resembles the fonts used in traditional Irish Restaurants and Pubs.
- To the left of the project name, you can see a Triquetra, whose icon was found on [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/triquetra_1506305?term=triquetra&page=1&position=7&page=1&position=7&related_id=1506305&origin=search).
    - The Triquetra, also known as The Trinity Knot, is an ancient symbol used by the Irish Celts.
    - It represents, among many things, the three stages of life, earth, sea and sky, past, present and future.
    - It was later adopted by the Christians and seamleslly assimilated by representing the Holy Trinity.

##### Body
------
- The body font is the standard Bootstrap font, "Helvetica Neue". 
    - I decided not to change it as it provides good enough readability and I saw no gains in changing the body font.

- The bigger text are also Bootstrap default called "Display" and "Lead". 
    - They stand out more than the normal Headings and Paragraphs and have a lighter font-weight, which compliments the general website design.

#### Effects and Feedback:
- In order to provide a pleasant and intuitive experience, CSS effects were used in the main elements where interaction is possible.
- These include:
    - Links and buttons and input fields changing color to let the user know they are being hovered or clicked.
    - Input fields with a green border at the bottom when Focused.
    - Divs that change colors along with a small border shadow when hovered.

#### Images:
- When users create a recipe but do not provide an image URL, a placeholder image will be inserted instead.
- This placeholder image was edited on Photoshop, and features the project name in font Sherwood, the Triquetra and a background with a food drawing pattern.
    - The pattern is a free image from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-delicious-food-background_5107183.htm#page=1&query=food%20background&position=0), created by artist [@pikisuperstar](https://www.freepik.com/pikisuperstar). 

- To aid in user navigation and provide feedback, I used free icons offered by [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
    - Both were imported and used as fonts that can be manipulated using CSS.
    - I believe this is superior to regular Images as they won't lose quality when zoomed-in.
